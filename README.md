# Div and Curl
A VR Vector Field Experience by Will Hanstedt

## Overview
The objective of this project was to create a VR experience that could help students gain intuition about divergence and curl. In particular, I wished to make use of the non-standard definitions of these quantities (the limit integrals), since I find those more intuitive than the differential definitions. I wanted the project to help students be able to both estimate the quantities from visuals of the fields, and discern information about the fields from knowledge of the quantities. In addition, the students should be able to connect the different definitions and see how each led to the others. 

## Installation
This project was developed with Unity 2020.3 for the Oculus Rift. It can be downloaded from the zipped folder in the releases page and run from the .exe file there, or it can be cloned and run with Unity Editor.
