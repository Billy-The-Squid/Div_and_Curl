Debug Log

System currently crashes when moving detector into field.

Tried commenting out second for loop.
* Doesn't crash. This, uh, narrows it down.

Uncommented that and commented out the contents of the loop alone.
* Also doesn't crash.

Uncomment this and have _TotalFlux[0] += 1
* Remains intact, returns 515

Allow _Areas[i] into the Uncommented portion
* Seems healthy. Returning a value around 0.7? This is...weird, considering what we expect the area of a 0.02-radius sphere to be.
* We'll have to come back to this. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
* Varies slightly with motion.

Allow the division in.
* Returning about 0.24. Not the area we expect, again.

Multiply by _NumberOfTrianglesPerVertex[i], to check whether we can access it all right.
* Functional, returning about 1.8. Which means each vertex is connected to, on average, nine triangles?
* That's not right %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Remove last step, uncomment division. This *should* give us the area.
* Not crashing, returning about 0.05

Uncomment multiplication by _FluxContributions
* Still not crashing? But the value is significantly varying with position, which it maybe shouldn't?



New goals:
* Get flux in outwards field to near-constant.
* Get area-only version of flux consistent with what it should be.

Maybe the dot product normalization is messing with stuff? Removing that.
* Surprisingly fine. Reasonable colors, still functioned.
* Less variation, but still some abnormalities.

Creating a plane flux detector.
* Behaves just fine. Only generates field on one side of it, which is as expected. Contributions array seems constant (from first three values),
	as is expected from the field type.

Improving plane flux detector: unpacking, setting correct collider, removing inner surface.




Next: add debug outputs for the normals and examine those.

Uncommented normalize debugger and examined the outputs for the plane.
* When unrotated, gives (0.0, 1.0, 0.0). Similarly, when rotating, gives the outputs expected.

Re-disable the plane and reinstate the sphere.
Enter debug mode, set a debug array + breakpoint to the positions, and try to figure out which vertex is at index 0.
* Well, there's at least one redundancy: points 0, 406, and 494 are identical. They're all at
	(0.6, -0.6, -0.6), and identical to seven decimal places.m



Next: Attempting to figure out if areas are being calculated correctly.

Commented out the loop parts of the for loops in the kernel. Now they just run once.
* Getting NaNs for some flux values. I think we have to be careful that j = 0 returns a triangle with vertex 0.

Added Gizmo to draw both vertex 0 and its respective normal. Added Gizmos to draw normals for vertices 406 and 494.
* Only one line is visible---hopefully due to overlap. The vertex and line both transform appropriately under rotation.

The surface area of a sphere is 4 pi r^2, so the surface area of a 0.2m radius sphere should be 0.502655m^2.
Reverting the loops, but commenting out multiplying by the fluxContribution. This should return the surface area.
* Gives roughly 0.05368145. This does not vary with x or z rotation, but the last digit fluctuates with y rotation.
* I'm not super concerned with that miniscule fluctuation, but the face that we're an order of magnitude off bothers me.

Setting a debug point to examine the triangles. It's hard to tell, but it looks like the vertex 0 (or its companions)
should be attached to five triangles.
* 0 appears at: 51, 54. 406 appears at 918, 921. 494 appears at 1922.
* The triangle at 51 is: 0, 47, 170.
* The triangle at 54 is: 0, 170, 26.
* The triangle at 918 is: 406, 242, 407.
* The triangle at 921 is: 406, 83, 242.
* The triangle at 1922 is: 494, 492, 359.

Remove the loop part of the two for loops, set the one to calculate at triange 51 (j = 17) while the other outputs just vertex i = 0;
For the total flux, commented out everything past _Areas[i].
* "Total flux": 0.0001673863. Last two digits vary with the z rotation, but not with x or y.
* Last two digits also vary with translation in any direction.

Going to manually calculate this now. I'll set a debug point, get the positions of 0, 47, and 170, and do the math myself.
* Using the exact formula I got above, I got an answer that agreed. I also realized that I forgot the 0.5, so I added that to both.



Next test: see if total area increases with r^2.
Reinstated loops (still calculating just total area) [Note: not total area: the sum of all the areas of the triangles, * # of vertices. ]
* Total flux is now 0.3726286

Increased scale factors to 1.
* Total flux is now 9.315715 (off from expected 12.6). [Note: 12.6 is total area.]

Verified that it is, in fact, scaling with r^2. But the value is still wack.

Divided areas added to vertex logs by 3. I don't think we need to average over the number of triangles, so moved that (but kept it commented.)
* Total area calculated is 0.1242095. Still very not right.



Fixed the bounds on the first for loop. That didn't change anything.

Summed over number of triangles per vertex. Got 3 * number of triangles, as expected.

Checked the area of the plane. It was almost exact.

On a hunch, checked the radius of the scale-1 sphere. It's actually 0.5, so its area should be pi. This lines up with calculations.

Recalculated area of scale-0.2 sphere. We're getting the correct value.

Reinstate _FluxContributions part of total flux, now without average over number of triangles.
* Very little variation with rotation (only after 3 or 4 sig figs.) In Outwards field, similar results.




Can we decrease the variation if we make everything into doubles instead of floats?
