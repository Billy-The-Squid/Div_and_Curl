  name: Curl (Surface Integral)
  description: 'Just like divergence, curl can also be defined with the limit of
    a surface integral. In this case, though, the <b>cross product</b> of the field
    with the normal vector is used, discarding the components of the field that point
    into or out of the surface. '
  equation: {fileID: 21300000, guid: a69087652d39bfe458e9237ddb683bee, type: 3}
  equationDescription: "The left side of the equation is the full three-component
    curl vector. \nThe<size=45> </size>right side is a two-dimensional <b>closed
    surface</b> integral.\nThe<size=45> </size>limit shows that the estimate of the
    curl gets more accurate as the volume <i>V</i> enclosed by the surface gets smaller.
    \nd<i>A</i><size=45> </size>is, as with flux, a vector pointing outwards from
    the surface, with magnitude equal to a small portion of the surface's area. \nThe<size=45>
    </size>cross product of two vectors gives a vector that is perpendicular to both
    of them, and increases in magnitude as the angle between the two vectors increases.
    If <i>F</i> and d<i>A</i> are parallel, the cross product will be zero. \n\n<size=45>
    </size>"
  detector: 'The surface integral is being taken over the surface of the sphere.
    At each point, one set of vectors shows the value of the field while the other
    shows the result of the cross product between the normal and the field. What
    happens to the cross product vector when its field vector points straight out
    from the surface?


    The orange on the detector shows points where the cross
    product aligns with the total curl, while the purple shows where it points in
    the opposite direction. What do the colors look like at points where the curl
    is zero?


    If you think of the field as showing fluid flow, then think about
    how the field flowing over the surface would make the ball spin. The axis of
    this spin is aligned with the curl and the speed of the spin is proportional
    to the magnitude of the curl.'
