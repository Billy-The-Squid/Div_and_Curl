  description: 'This detector uses the computation most commonly used to to find
    divergence. Because it involves only derivatives, it is often easier to calculate
    than a limit integral. Can you see how this definition comes from the limit definition? '

  equationDescription: "      On the left is the notation used to represent divergence.\n<size=45>   
    </size>On the right is the sum of three partial derivatives of components of
    the field. Notice that this is a scalar value, not a vector. \n<size=45>    </size>Pay
    attention to the fact that the partial derivative is always in the same direction
    as the component. This is why divergence is only concerned with the outwards
    components of the field flow\u2014the other components are disregarded. "
  detector: "      Each pair of outer dots on the detector represents a change along
    one axis. The dots flowing out of the point represent the derivative of the field
    along that change\u2014their direction is that of the derivative and the speed
    is the magnitude of the derivative. \n<size=45>    </size>Notice that the flow
    is always inwards or outwards, never perpendicular to the change. Because divergence
    doesn't take those components into account for the computation, they don't need
    to be shown here. \n<size=45>    </size>Notice that the flow of the bubbles doesn't
    always point in the same direction as the vector field itself. Why is this? At
    which points <i>will</i> it align? "
