  description: 'This is the most common definition of curl, defined at a point rather
    than using a limit. Can you see how each component of this comes from the loop
    integral definition? '
  equation: {fileID: 21300000, guid: a40d9164b4f5411498640df0c1ab8fee, type: 3}
  equationDescription: "      The left side of the equation, curl, is a three-component
    vector, where each component is the difference of two partial derivatives of
    components of the field. \n<size=45>    </size>Notice that none of the partial
    derivatives are in the same direction as the component: there is no derivative
    of <i>F<sub>x</sub></i> with respect to <i>x</i>. This means that curl only takes
    into account changes in the field that point <b>around</b> the point, not away
    from or towards it. "
  detector: "      Each pair of dark blue dots on the detector represents a change
    along one axis. The bubbles flowing out of the point represent the derivative
    of the field along that change\u2014their direction is that of the derivative
    and the speed is the magnitude of the derivative. \n<size=45>    </size>Notice
    that the flow is never inwards or outwards. Because curl doesn't take that into
    account in its computation, those components don't need to be shown here. \n<size=45>   
    </size>Try to see if you can predict the direction of the curl just by looking
    at the detector (without looking at the numbers). Hint: when does the flow seem
    to form a circle?"
