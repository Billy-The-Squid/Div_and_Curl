  description: 'Each object, or "detector," you find on this podium corresponds to
    a mathematical calculation. Bring them into the field to see how they behave
    at different points and browse through these tabs to learn about the quantities
    they represent.

    This<size=45> </size>object doesn''t represent anything. '

  equationDescription: "This tab will tell you the most important information about
    each detector\u2014its governing equation. This is a specific way of computing
    a specific quantity. \nIn<size=45> </size>the above equation, the length <i>c</i>
    of the hypotenuse of a right triangle can be compute from the lengths <i>a</i>
    and <i>b</i> of the two legs."
  detector: 'This tab will tell you about how each detector behaves. The colors,
    motion, and the vectors on the surface of each detector correspond to different
    parts of the definition of the quantity the detector represents. See how much
    of this you can figure out about each detector before looking at this tab!

    This<size=45>
    </size>detector has nothing to do with any equation. It just spins.'
