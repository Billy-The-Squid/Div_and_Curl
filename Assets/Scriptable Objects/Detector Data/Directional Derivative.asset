  name: Directional Derivative
  description: 'The directional derivative of a quantity is the measure of how much
    that quantity changes due to a small shift in a certain direction. Because the
    fields are made of three-component vectors, their derivatives are also three-component
    vectors. '
  equation: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 5af2e2dfb1ae37d46a144d1ce4de85ac, type: 3}
  equationDescription: "      On the left side of the equation is the derivative
    of the vector field <b><i>F</i></b> with respect to a shift in the direction
    of the unit vector <b><i>u</i></b>. \n<size=45>    </size>Each term on the right
    side of the equation is the partial derivative of the field with respect to a
    single coordinate, times the component in that direction of <b><i>u</i></b>.
    How does this equation simplify when <b><i>u</i></b> points along one of the
    three axes?"
  detector: "      The three pink dots in the detector show the line along which
    the directional derivative is taken. The bubbles coming off of the outer dots
    represent the derivative itself\u2014their direction is that of the derivative
    and their speed is proportional to its magnitude. \n<size=45>    </size>How does
    the detector's appearance change if you rotate it in a half-circle? How does
    its number output change?\n<size=45>    </size>When you have access to the differential
    divergence and curl detectors, try comparing their behavior with that of this
    detector. How do all of those differ from each other? How does that make sense
    from their definitions?"
