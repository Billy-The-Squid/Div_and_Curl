  description: "The divergence of a field at a point is a measure of how much the
    field points inwards or outwards. Points with positive divergence have more (or
    larger) vectors pointing away from them than towards them, and points with negative
    divergence, fewer. \n\nFlux calculates the flow of the field through a surface.
    It is an integral, the integrand of which is the outward component of the field
    at each point. Divergence can be defined by taking the limit of flux as the surface
    shrinks."

  equationDescription: "      The notation on the left is the derivative. Flux itself
    is the integral inside the limit on the right.  \n<size=45>    </size>The right
    side of the equation is a two-dimensional <b>closed surface</b> integral. \n<size=45>   
    </size>The limit is taken as the volume enclosed by that surface approaches zero.
    \n<size=45>    </size><b>d<i>A</i></b> is a normal vector. It points directly
    outwards from the surface at each point and has a magnitude equal to the small
    piece of the surface area around that point. \n<size=45>    </size>The <b>dot
    product</b> measures how much two vectors align with each other. If <b><i>F</i></b>
    and <b>d<i>A</i></b> point in the same direction, it is the product of their
    magnitudes. If they are perpendicular, it is zero. "
  detector: "      The surface integral is being taken over the surface of the sphere.
    At each point, one set of vectors shows the value of the field while the other
    shows the result of the dot product between the normal and the field (technically,
    the projection of the field onto the normal). What happens to the projection
    vector when its field vector points directly out from the surface?\n<size=45>   
    </size>The orange on the detector shows points where the dot product is positive,
    while the purple shows where it is negative. What do the colors look like at
    points where the divergence is zero?\n<size=45>    </size>If you think of the
    field as showing fluid flow, then think about how the field is passing through
    the surface\u2014is it, over the whole surface, going inwards or outwards? This
    flow is proportional to the flux. Divide that by the volume inside the sphere,
    and you have the average divergence. "
