  name: Curl (Loop Integral)
  description: The curl of a vector field can be thought of how much the field spins
    around a point. This is quantified as a line integral around a loop using Stokes'
    theorem.
  equation: {fileID: 21300000, guid: bddadeb4d40b4824092308450018c833, type: 3}
  equationDescription: "The left side of the equation is the dot product of the curl
    and the normal, a unit vector perpendicular to the loop. This gives a single
    component of the curl. \n<i>A</i><size=45> </size>is the area enclosed by the
    loop. \nThe integral<size=45> </size>is a <b>closed line</b> integral, and d<i>s</i>
    is a small portion of that line. "
  detector: "As you take a line integral in a circle, how much does the field align
    with that loop? \n<line-indent=15%>The central arrow shows just the component
    of the curl that points perpendicular to the loop. Along the edge, orange arrows
    show where the field points in the same direction as the loop, while purple arrows
    show where it points in the opposite direction. \nTry changing the size of this
    detector and watch how the integral quantity (divided by the area) approaches
    a limit as the area gets smaller. What do you think the culr at each point is? "
