  name: Curl (Loop Integral)
  description: "The curl of a vector field can be thought of how much the field spins
    around a point. If the curl of a field points upwards, the field around that
    point likely swirls counterclockwise. \n\nStokes' Theorem relates the average
    curl over a surface to a line integral around the boundary of the surface. We
    can use that to define curl in terms of the limit of a loop as the loop shrinks
    down to a single point. "
  equation: {fileID: 21300000, guid: bddadeb4d40b4824092308450018c833, type: 3}
  equationDescription: "      The left side of the equation is the dot product of
    the curl (represented as the cross product of <b>nabla</b> (the upside-down triangle)
    and the field) and the normal, a unit vector perpendicular to the loop. This
    gives us a single component of the curl. \n<size=45>    </size><i>A</i> is the
    area enclosed by the loop. \n<size=45>    </size>The integral is a <b>closed
    line</b> integral, and <b>d<i>s</i></b> is a small portion of that line. \n<size=45>   
    </size>The <b>dot product</b> measures how much two vectors align with each other.
    If <b><i>F</i></b> and <b>d<i>s</i></b> point in the same direction, it is the
    product of their magnitudes. If they are perpendicular, it is zero. "
  detector: "      As you take a line integral in a circle, how much does the field
    align with that loop? \n<size=45>    </size>The central arrow shows just the
    component of the curl that points perpendicular to the loop. Along the edge,
    orange arrows show where the field points in the same direction as the loop,
    while purple arrows show where it points in the opposite direction. \n<size=45>   
    </size>Try changing the size of this detector and watch how the integral quantity
    (divided by the area) approaches a limit as the area gets smaller. What do you
    think the curl at each point is? "
